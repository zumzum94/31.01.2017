<p>I have a cat named Gracie.
    She is a gray cat, nine years old and her birthday is in August.
    She is usually running away from Kaiya and Ezra but luckily she is speedy!
    Sometimes she leaves the house and is out for hours!
    When she is out for hours, sometimes she will catch a mouse!
    She is almost always crossing  roads and runs far in the neighborhood.
    A while ago we had eight pets, four cats and four fish but unluckily, they all died.
    Meow!</p>
